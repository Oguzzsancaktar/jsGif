# JavaScript Fade-in Fade-out Gif !

- I decided to take action after I thought that the images we used to present our product in the company I work for were insufficient.

- My first thought was to shrink a few png files into animated pngs, or use gifs.

- I can say that I predict that the size of these images will be large and reduce performance, i got more than i expected...

## Making gif ?

- First of all, after a short research, I learned that animations can be made easily by using the timeline in the photoshop program. But it was taking time and I would have to spend a lot of time getting the result I wanted enough. I decided it wasn't worth spending so much time on a little beautification.

- So I decided to search the solution on google. I found site which is ezgif.com and I tryed. Ezgif.com had a optimize tool but each gifs size much more 6.5 mb.

- So In conculusion I made my gif program with javascript and I know Its not takes 6.5MB in my server memory it tooks 100kb maybe :D.

- So you can try it. If you like the script you can star my project and lookup others...
